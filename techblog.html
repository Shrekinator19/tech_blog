   <p> Essentially, what the YouTube video, "Humans Need not Apply," is trying to convey is that the entire human race will go extinct and all human activity will have been bestowed upon by artificial intelligence (a.k.a. robots). Well, that may sound a bit too extreme. But debatable points like self-automated cars outperforming human drivers are what evoke a sense of propaganda.</p>
   <p> Although I cannot deny that the realization of artificial intelligence is an inevitable possibility, it's how we as a race choose to cooperate and utilize this technology. For example, people who specialize in forensic science can use fingerprint scanning or DNA samples to determine who would be the culprit in a murder scenario. What turns humans off from A.I. is how the bots can develop a prejudice against mankind and committ acts obscene to an extent (if you thought Vladimir Putin's cronies hacked the 2016 Presidential Election and chose Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders, think again!). We have to choose wisely how human beings can bond with technology so that our planet won't become a dystopian wasteland.</p>

    <p class="article_summary"> "Knowing Even Where Your Shoes Are"
     explains how the technology behind barcodes affects A.I.'s interpretation of information depending on a particular scenario. For instance, clothing retailers use barcodes off clothes to keep a record of outfits by size, color, and what have you. Therefore, the encrypted data is kept on file and it helps retailers make a profit.</p>
    <p class="article_summary"> "The Parking Garage Knows More Than You Think"
     is, in a nutshell, A.I. programmed to automatically alert drivers whether or not they picked up a ticket wihen driving on the thru-way. Smart tech at its finest.</p>
    <p class="article_summary"> "Saving Money"
     elaborates the similar underlying themes of smart technology violating people's privacy. The capabilities of Safeway are no different.</p>
    <p class="article_summary">  As haunting as all this chatter of A.I. posing issues for the  human race sounds, it can't hurt to be the slightest optimistic because we can only live with the technology we have in the present and not always look toward the ambiguity of the future. It's not healthy.</p>

<h2>Blog Post 3</h2>

<h3>by Hugo Segal</h3>

   <p class="description_dad"> My father, Ray Segal, was born around the time television became an aspect of his life that shaped his youth. But truth be told, he may not quite be as computer-illiterate as you would think. This was the interview I conducted.</p>

    <p class="my_lines">Me: How old were you when you got your first computer?</p>
    <p class="dad_lines">Dad: Huh... Wow, that's a fascinating question! I probably owned a computer around... 1981. 16-17ish. I had moved to New York at that point. Computers did exist when I was growing up, but there had yet to be computers for personal use until then.</p>
    <p class="my_lines">Me: What was your favorite piece of technology when you were growing up? And why?</p>
    <p>Dad: If I had to guess, I would choose the television because it factored into my curiosity about the world, it gave me immense pleasure, and I was purely amused.</p>
    <p class="my_lines">Me: How has technology changed over your lifetime?</p>
    <p>Dad: Whoa!! Gee, I'd have to think on that one... um... Well, I used to work with analog video since leaving college, only for digital to replace what I was used to. Part of the beauty of evolving technology is that with an increase of manufacturing, products we now consider a necessity help solve our problems efficiently in no-time-flat.</p>
    <p class="my_lines">Me: Have the changes you've seen in technology over your lifetime mostly helped or hurt society?</p>
    <p>Dad: Man, you're asking some good questions! Umm... I'd say technology has helped, but the jury's still out on that front.</p>
    <p class="my_lines">Me: What is your greatest hope for technology in the future?</p>
    <p>Dad: Hmm... Theoretically, I'd hope we restore balance with the world, replenish an ecosystem that we're really polluting, and every oppressed individual can find their voice.</p>
    <p class="my_lines">Me: What is your greatest fear for technology in the future?</p>
    <p >Dad: Quite the opposite of my hopes. Currently, we're struggling with a divide amongst the social classes and innovations spurting from the news could potentially act as a nuisance toward resolving human ecological and social dilemmas.</p>
    <p class="my_lines">Me: What advice would you like to share with the younger generation about technology? Can you give some examples?</p>
    <p>Dad: Yeah, absolutely! I'd say that technology is neutral. You can use it for good or evil but you should think twice about how you use it. Social media, for example, can act as a haven for people with similar interests. Yet, the unfortunate consequence is that we undermine democratic institutions and over-exploit hate speech to the extent where censorship remains a debatable issue.</p>
    <p class="my_lines">Me: What was the first DVD or VHS tape you ever played?</p>
    <p>Dad: Damn!! (chuckles) It's funny you mention home entertainment because back in the '90s, I used to be a consultant for McGraw Hill and oversaw the development of the first educational CD-Roms. I think it was 1992-1995 that I worked with CD-Roms, professionally speaking. In terms of personal usage, I've viewed a comedy and a late '90s interpretation of Cabaret. I never got my hands on a VHS tape until around, say, my high school/early college years in the late '70s-early '80s.</p>
    <p class="my_lines">Me: One last question. Were you aware of the advent of CGI when Toy Story was released back in November 1995?</p>
    <p>Dad: (chuckles) I mean bear in mind, I had my hands full with raising your brother, Oscar, as an infant in addition to researching for "Hawaii's Last Queen." Um... I wasn't aware of CG until maybe 2001? Do you remember what films came out that year that implemented CG?</p>
    <p class="my_lines">Me: Of course. "Shrek", "Monsters, Inc"., "Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius", "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone", and "Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Rings."</p>
    <p>Dad: I think we took you to the former three when you were a baby. I missed the first Lord of the Rings, but what astounded me was how you could animate crowds of people or creatures within one scene. I mean, thousands of individual people can be implemented. It was jaw-dropping at the time.</p>
